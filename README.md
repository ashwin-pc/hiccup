## Getting started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Serve the release build or use any of the available react scripts to run the app.
The startpage uses a `config.json` file as the source of truth for page. It can be modified locally but the result will only be saved on the browsers `localStorage` and persist across sessions.

### Installation

To use the app, you have many options

#### [Hosted site](https://test.designedbyashw.in/hiccup)

I have hosted an instance of the app [here](https://test.designedbyashw.in/hiccup). Since this is a static site, chages you make to the links only exist locally on your browser and are never sent anywhere. To save the links to other browsers, just doenload the config file from the editor using the download button and drag the config file onto a new instance of hiccup on your new browser. The links in your config stay private. You can even have multiple config files that you can load based on your need.

#### Docker

To run the app using docker the image `bleckbeard/hiccup:latest`. You can use the command below or the `docker-compose.yaml` file from the repo. Be sure to change the volume to the location of your local config file. Use the one in `./public/configs/config.json` for reference.

```
docker run \
    -p 8899:80 \
    -v `pwd`/public/configs/config.json:/usr/share/nginx/html/configs/config.json \
    bleckbeard/hiccup:latest
```

#### Using a static site host

You cann download the built file or build it yourself and deploy to a static site provider like netlify or github-pages (or any other way to host a static site). To persist the config, edit the local config file. You can always sync the version of your config file to this using the config editor.

### Hotkeys

The app has a few hotkeys to help you easily navigate around. To quickly view the available hotkeys, use the `Cmd/Ctrl + /` hotkey!

> Note: Hotkeys do not work when the search is bar is in focus. Use `Tab` to focus out of the search bar and into the app or click anywhere outside the search bar to use hotkeys

### Using Search

The purpose of the search is to get to you link as easily as possible.

- Press `UpArrow` and `DownArrow` to navigate the search
- Press `Esc` to quit the search
- Hit `Enter` to open the first highlighted link amongst search results. (Featured cards have a star and the Search provider is marked by a globe)

Search looks at the `name`, `link` and `tags` field of each link in the config to find a match.

### Using Edit mode

The edit mode can be activated using `Cmd/Ctrl + e` or the ✏️ icon on the bottom right of the screen. To exit the edit mode at any time use `Esc` or the commands used to start editing. The Edit mode lets you add, delete and edit links on the startpage.

The feaures currently supported are:

- Add, edit and delete upto 4 featured cards
- Add, edit and delete upto 4 categories
- Add, edit and delete category links

These limits were place intentionally to
For more flexibility, you can directly edit the config using the config editor (described in the next section)

e.g.:

- Remove the category of featured section entirely
- Add more than 4 categories or featured cards

> The `Edit mode` alters the config and if you ever wish to revert to the original config.json file, click the trash icon in the config editor to completely reset the config state.

### Using Config

Since this is a static website, all edits made are local and the new config must uploaded to a server from where the configs can be fetched. To make this process easier, Hiccup comes with a built in config manager. The config manager allows you to:

- Load a config file from either URL or local file
- Manage multiple configs (Preview, Select, Sync, Delete)
- Download config file

you can also additionally share hiccup with a preloaded config using the `config` url parameter.

e.g.

```
http://designedbyashw.in/test/hiccup?config=http://your-url.com/config.json
```

> Since this is a CORS request, the server should allow requests from the source domain. Github Gists are an easy way to save remote config's

#### Using with github gists

To save a config on github gists.

1. Create the hiccup view you want and download the config.
1. Copy the contents of the file to the gist
1. Click Creat a **Public** Gist
1. Copy the url and add `/raw` to the end. This is now your config URL

Share the config with anyone to load in their instance of hiccup

#### Migrations

If you were using an older version of Hiccup (< v0.4.x), the config manager will automatically recover the old cached config and promt you to save it using the new version. download the recovered config and redistribute it as needed.

All the config information is stored in **LocalStorage** and never sent to a server anywhere!

#### Config structure

Refer to the [JSON Scheme file](src/modules/validateConfig/schema.json) for the latest schema.

### Caching

The app now supports 4 caching strategies, these are useful if you dont want to frequently update your configs or run it completely offine

Strategies:

- `cache`: Use only the local cache to save and fetch data
- `network`: Use only the network values and fail if you cannot get it
- `cache-first`: If not found in the cache, fallback to the remote URL
- `network-first`: (Default) If not found in the remote server, fallback to the cached value

You can set this value using the URL parameter `cache`

e.g.

```
http://designedbyashw.in/test/hiccup?cache=network
```

## Available Scripts for development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
